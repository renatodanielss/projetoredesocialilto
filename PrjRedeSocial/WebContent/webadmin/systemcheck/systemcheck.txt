Scripts should return their test results to the web content management system through the "systemcheck" session variable.
Test results should be simple texts starting with either "OK:", "NOTE:" or "ERROR:" to indicate if the test failed or was successful or if something should be noted.

For example:

	ASP.NET:
		<%@ Page Language="C#" Debug="true" ValidateRequest="false" %>
		<%
		Session["systemcheck"] = "OK: This test succeded.";
		%>

	JSP:
		<%
		session.setAttribute("systemcheck", "NOTE: Please note this.");
		%>

	PHP:
		<?php
		$_SESSION["systemcheck"] = "ERROR: This test failed.";
		?>
